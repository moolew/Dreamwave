the code below demonstrates a single note and all of its data

there are 4 lanes but you start iterating from 0 so 0-3 lanes
---
position is the y position on the chart, higher the value the further down the note goes
---
type is which note will be instanced / N = normal - H = hold
---
length is checked only if the type is of H and if so you define how long the hold is

# start
lane=0
position=0.5
type=N
# end

# start
lane=3
position=2
type=N
# end

# start
lane=2
position=4.5
type=N
# end

# start
lane=1
position=10
type=N
# end
